## Mindsets Results

### Purpose

In collaboration with Shane McCarty and Promote Care & Promote Harm, I created a new version of the "Mindsets to Promote Care & Prevent Harm" quiz. This project contains the results component.

This version of the app is currently taking-in data and has not been published yet.
